# recommendation-system
This is a small movie recommendation system project that I made in Jupyter Notebook to practice with Python libraries and some machine learning techniques!
Currently, it provides some movies that are similar to a particular movie that the user inputs from the function in Python. 

Roadmap:
- Create frontend and website
- Deploy using Heroku
- Add more movies and TV shows into the mix
- Add filters to enhance the quality of movies recommended
- Implement a different algorithm that finds similar movies through other ways.

The dataset used is the tmdb_5000 dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains over 5000 of the highest rated movies on TMDB.
