# recommendation-system
This is a small movie recommendation system project that I made in Jupyter Notebook to practice with Python libraries and some machine learning techniques!

Things that I have learnt and developed throughout this project:
- Data pre-processing and cleaning techniques using Pandas 
- Machine learning algorithm + Cosine distance matrix calculations and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Using streamlit to make a website
- Use TMDB API to import movie image covers
- Deploying my website to the cloud using Heroku and Git processes

Roadmap:
- ~~Create frontend and website using Streamlit~~
- ~~Deploy to cloud using Heroku~~
- Add more movies and TV shows into the mix
- Add filters to enhance the quality of movies recommended
- Implement a different algorithm that finds similar movies through other ways.

The dataset used is the tmdb_5000 dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. It contains over 5000 of the highest rated movies on TMDB.
